## Folder Structure
The main code is in the src folder. Index.html file is present inpublic folder from where all the other components are connected.
All the images are stored in the assests folder which is in components folder.
Package.json file consist of all the pakages which is used in this project.

### How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Firstly, I thought of making header and footer part as it is used in all components.
Then, I moved on to the movies and series component as this was the major part of the project. Their styling was almost same so created one of them perfectly and then copied to another one.
I created the Home page.
Then finally, I started fetching json objects in movies and series component accordingly

### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes I would have also displayed few more details to card as the details are limited.
I would have added series and movies link to nav bar also.

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
Actually there was my college exam in this past two days, so i cannot gave my 100 percent to this project.
I have made almost everything according to the need but i could not limit data to 21 and the sorting part.
Rest all the filtering i have applied.

I would have added pagination to this if given more time.
Could have made more interactive UI.

I hope you will appreciate my work
