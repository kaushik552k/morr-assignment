## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Firstly, I thought of making header and footer part as it is used in all components.
Then, I moved on to the movies and series component as this was the major part of the project. Their styling was almost same so created one of them perfectly and then copied to another one.
I created the Home page.
Then finally, I started fetching json objects in movies and series component accordingly
